Extended Hopping model

As of 2023-08-25, this project repo is composed of
1. QNsectors: this piece of code calculates the ground state in each (Nf,Sz) quantum number sector. Enables the calculation of spin and charge gaps in the model
2. gap: simplified code to calculate the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state.
3. correlations: more detailed calculation of the gap up to third excited state. This piece of code also calculated the spin and density correlators of the ground state
