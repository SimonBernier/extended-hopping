Extended Hopping model

As of 2023-08-25, this project repo is composed of
1. QNsectors: this piece of code calculates the ground state in each (Nf,Sz) quantum number sector. Enables the calculation of spin and charge gaps in the model
2. gap: simplified code to calculate the energy gap between the ground state and first excited state.
3. correlations: more detailed calculation of the gap up to third excited state. This piece of code also calculated the spin and density correlators of the ground state

The programs require input files to run. The parameters that can be passed to the programs can be found in the sample input files provided in each folder.
